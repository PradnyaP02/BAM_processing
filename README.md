# BAM_processing 
This repository will contain the code written to process the BAM file.
The script will help us to get the following information - 
1. Total number of "On target reads"
2. Number of reads having mapping quality greater than 20
3. Filter reads with mismatch rate higher than 0.1

The script is written in Python language and SAMtools Python package "pysam" is used.
